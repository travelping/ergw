;  This particular operator only supports LTE access in their accesses etc.  
;  So the S3 record is commented out above. If the operator wants the MME to be used with S3/S4
;  SGSN nodes then the record would have to be included. 
;  The Gn/Gp interface is commented out for same reason. This operator does not support it. 
;  If the operator wants the MME to be used for Gn/Gp SGSN interworking
;  then the record would have to be included. 
;
;   Reminder: Canonical node name records must be complete.
;   However, "x-3gpp-mme:x-s1-mme" is an exception.  
;   While S1-MME interface must be physically present and used in a MME
;   it is explicitly optional for an operator to provision in this release of 3GPP
;.  So it too is commented out

; NAPTR order plays no major role in this particular example since the MME node is already 
; selected in GUTI case and as a canonical node name. In most cases the interface type 
;(S10 vs S11 etc) is functionally determined so the NAPTR order is rarely used in this record set
; If the S3 and Gn records were not commented out the S10 is preferred over S3 over Gn 
; I.e. a combined MME/SGSN  could communicate to the MME above using any of the three protocols 
; at context transfer. 
; So the operator is stating that S10 is preferred over S3 over Gn
;
; Of course if the MME had multiple S10 interfaces 
; the operator could provision more than one S10 record with different orders 
; perhaps to select S10 IPv6 over S10 IPv4
 
 
; We have the same type of records for the other MME (same comments would apply)
