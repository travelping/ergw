; Note relative value of NAPTR order is important between the S5/S8 records,  
; relative value of NAPTR order is important between the S10 records,  
; relative value of NAPTR order is important between the S11 records 
; but is not really important between different interface types used here 
; (i.e. the MME selection procedure does not look for an SGW interface)

;  This operators policy is PMIPv6 is used only as last choice
