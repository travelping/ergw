erGW - 3GPP GGSN and PDN-GW in Erlang
=====================================
[![Build Status][travis badge]][travis]
[![Coverage Status][coveralls badge]][coveralls]
[![Erlang Versions][erlang version badge]][travis]

This is a 3GPP GGSN and PDN-GW implemented in Erlang. It strives to eventually support all the functionality as defined by [3GPP TS 23.002](http://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/23002.htm) Section 4.1.3.1 for the GGSN and Section 4.1.4.2.2 for the PDN-GW.

IMPLEMENTED FEATURES
--------------------

Messages:

 * GTPv1 Create/Update/Delete PDP Context Request on Gn
 * GTPv2 Create/Delete Session Request on S5/S8

From the above the following procedures as defined by 3GPP T 23.060 should work:

 * PDP Context Activation/Modification/Deactivation Procedure
 * PDP Context Activation/Modification/Deactivation Procedure using S4
 * Intersystem Change Procedures (handover 2G/3G/LTE)
 * 3GPP TS 23.401:
   * Sect. 5.4.2.2, HSS Initiated Subscribed QoS Modification (without PCRF)
   * Annex D, Interoperation with Gn/Gp SGSNs procedures (see [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md))

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
---------------------

Experimental features may change or be removed at any moment. Configuration settings
for them are not guaranteed to work across versions. Check [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md) and
[NEWS.md](NEWS.md) on version upgrades.

 * rate limiting, defaults to 100 requests/second
 * metrics, see [METRICS.md](METRICS.md)

USER PLANE
----------

erGW usese the 3GPP control and user plane separation of EPC nodes architecture as layed out
in [3GPP TS 23.214](http://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/23244.htm) and [3GPP TS 29.244](http://www.3gpp.org/dynareport/29244.htm).

RADIUS over Gi/SGi
------------------

**Normal AAA integration is currently not working the feature/rf branch.**

The GGSN Gn interface supports RADIUS over the Gi interface as specified by 3GPP TS 29.061 Section 16.
At the moment, only the Authentication and Authorization is supported, Accounting is not supported.

See [RADIUS.md](RADIUS.md) for a list of supported Attrbiutes.

Many thanks to [On Waves](https://www.on-waves.com/) for sponsoring the RADIUS Authentication implementation.

ONLINE/OFFLINE CHARING
----------------------

Online charging through Gy works with the following caveats:

 * When multiple rating groups are in use, CCR Update requests will contain unit
   reservation requests for all rating groups, however they should only contain the entries
   for the rating groups where new quotas, threshold and validity's are needed.

Offline charging through Rf is somewhat functional in "independent online and offline
charging" mode (tight interworking of online and offline charging is not supported).
The following caveats apply:

 * only expiry of time limit is supported as trigger for addition to "List of Service Data",
   most importantly, **none of the IP-CAN bearer modification triggers are supported**,
   see 3GPP TS 32.251, Table 5.2.3.4.1.1 for the triggers that *should* be supported.
 * only a few fields in the Service-Data-Container are filed, those are:
   * Accounting-Input-Octets
   * Accounting-Output-Octets
   * Local-Sequence-Number
   * Rating-Group
   * Time-First-Usage
   * Time-Last-Usage
   * Time-Usage

MISSING FEATURES
----------------

The following procedures are assumed/known to be *NOT* working:

 * Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure
 * Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure using S4

Other shortcomings:

 * QoS parameters are hard-coded

ERLANG Version Support
----------------------

All minor version of the current major release and the highest minor version of the
previous major release will be supported.
At the moment this means OTP 20.3.8, OTP 21.1 and OTP 21.2 are supported. OTP versions
greater than 20.1.7 could work, but are not tested or guaranteed to work. When in doubt
check the `otp_release` section in [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for tested versions.

BUILDING
--------

*The minimum supported Erlang version is 20.1.7.*

Erlang 21.1.1 is the recommended version. Support for version prior to 20.3.8 will
dropped at the end of 2018.

Using rebar:

    # rebar3 compile

RUNNING
-------

A erGW installation needs a user plane provider to handle the GTP-U path. This instance can be installed on the same host or a different host.

A suitable user plane node based on [VPP](https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP) can be found at [VPP-UFP](https://github.com/travelping/vpp/tree/feature/upf).

erGW can be started with the normal Erlang command line tools, e.g.:

```
erl -setcookie secret -sname ergw -config ergw.config
Erlang/OTP 19 [erts-8.0.3] [source] [64-bit] [async-threads:10] [kernel-poll:false]

Eshell V8.0.3  (abort with ^G)
(ergw@localhost)1> application:ensure_all_started(ergw).
```

This requires a suitable ergw.config, e.g.:

```erlang
%-*-Erlang-*-

	  {log_dir,  "/var/log/ergw-c-node"}				%% NOTE: lager is not using this
